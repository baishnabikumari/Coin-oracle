# ü™ô Coin Oracle

Coin Oracle is an interactive web application and a fun game that I created, where a user gets to spend coins either to get a random fortune, or roll dice and get a bigger prize.

The concept was inspired by the desire to combine a game of chance simulator with a mini economy. I created the interface, included the light/dark themes, and ensured that the animations were smooth and satisfactory. A toss is 10 coins, and a realistic animated coin-flip is involved, and on a win, you are given more coins back.

I have studied to use JavaScript to handle events, local storage to store progress and CSS transitions to animate the coin and other elements of the user interface. Timing the coin animation was one of the most difficult aspects and balancing the reward system to make it feel just is also a difficult task.
